      "description" : "The 2011 Tolling Impact Survey measured the impact of tolling on travel behavior in Seattle, Washington. The Volpe Center conducted the survey on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Urban Partnership Agreement. The population surveyed included drivers, public transportation users, carpoolers, and vanpoolers using the SR-520 corridor in Seattle. The survey was conducted in two phases—before and after toll implementation—to evaluate related attitude changes. The survey assessed route changes, trip timing, trip purpose, and travel mode (i.e., single-occupancy vehicle, carpool, or public transportation).",

The survey was conducted by PTV NuStats, GeoStats, and PG Americas Inc. on behalf of the Atlanta Regional Commission. The goal was to collect trip data from a minimum of 10,000 households with a subsample of 1,000 households providing global positioning system (GPS) data. The GPS add-on consisted of two sample groups. The first sample group was provided with GPS devices to install in their personal vehicles (797 vehicles) to collect the speed and location of a vehicle during an assigned study period. The second sample group (1,653 participants) was provided with a wearable GPS device to collect the speed and location of an individual during an assigned study period. People participating in the wearable add-on part of the study were chosen because their travel diaries reported use of public transit in day-to-day travel. Each GPS participant was grouped into either the spring phase (March to May 2011) or the fall phase (July to September 2011), and data were recorded for a maximum of seven days for vehicle units and three days for wearable units.",

At the time, it was the largest such regional or statewide survey ever conducted in the United States. Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable (7,574 participants) and in-vehicle (2,910 vehicles) global positioning system devices, and on-board diagnostic sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state. The CHTS included additional features, such as vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips, to support advanced model development.",

ICF International conducted the survey on behalf of the California Energy Commission. Approximately 8,000 respondents, from California households and businesses, completed the survey. The household component of the CVS included a selection of households from the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS), who had stated their intention to purchase a vehicle in the near future. Both household surveys used the same survey ID numbers enabling the integration of responses. The commercial vehicle component of the CVS—a stand-alone survey of commercial fleet owners in California—asked vehicle owners questions pertaining to economic and demographic attributes, current fleets, and preferences about planned vehicle purchases.",

It included households in eight counties in Illinois and three in Indiana. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning conducted the study in coordination with the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission, and the Indiana Department of Transportation. Travel and activity information for all household members (regardless of age) was collected during a randomly assigned 24- or 48-hour period. It relied on the willingness of households to provide detailed information about their members and vehicles, and to record all travel and associated activity during the collection period. This study also featured a subsample of households collecting data via in-vehicle and wearable global positioning system devices.",

It features data from households across nine counties in the region, including southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) sponsored the survey, which was administered by Abt Srbi Inc. A sampling strategy was designed to recruit households for survey participation that would best represent overall regional travel trends. Households were selected randomly, but with special consideration given to under-represented geographies and transit propensity. On their assigned travel day, households were asked to record all trips made within a 24-hour period. Additionally, select households were chosen to participate in a wearable global positioning system (GPS) technology-based component of the study. A total of 811 participants wore the GPS system.",

The planning region in Alaska comprised the North Star Borough—known as the PM2.5 nonattainment region—and included the cities of Fairbanks and North Pole. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities sponsored the survey, which was conducted by Westat. Data collection occurred in two phases: fall 2013 and winter 2014. The first phase employed address-based sampling to recruit more than 1,700 households for a one-day personal travel survey and a subsample participated with global position system (GPS) and on-board diagnostic (OBD) loggers installed in their vehicles (282 vehicles) for one week. The purpose of phase one was to better understand the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in the PM2.5 nonattainment region. Many of the households participating in the vehicle GPS/OBD portion of phase one were asked to participate in phase two.",

The Mid-America Regional Council and the Kansas and Missouri Departments of Transportation sponsored the survey, which was administered by NuStats. Activity and travel information was collected for all household members, regardless of age, during a specific 24-hour period. It relied on the willingness of households to provide demographic information about its members and vehicles and to have all household members record all travel and activity for a specific 24-hour period. The study also included a subsample of household vehicles with global positioning system (GPS) devices. The objectives of the GPS component were twofold: (1) to provide an independent data stream of vehicular travel in order to measure the accuracy of the travel data reported over the telephone, and (2) to obtain details about those trips that were captured by GPS but not reported over the telephone, in order to derive a trip-correction factor.",

The Madison County Council of Governments sponsored the study, which was administered by Resource Systems Group and conducted from February to March 2015. It used an activity sampling or \"random moments\" sampling approach via a smartphone application to capture travel behavior and characteristics from the survey participants. This approach included brief smartphone interactions, e.g., a few minutes per interaction, conducted multiple times a day over multiple days, which was considered less burdensome than traditional household travel diary surveys, which often require 20-30 minutes in one sitting. This proof-of-concept study included households that also participated in the 2014 Heartland in Motion household travel diary survey. Because of this, an assessment of the accuracy and completeness of the collected smartphone application data and comparisons between the \"random moments\" sample method and traditional household travel surveys can conceivably be drawn.",

      "description" : "The 2010-2012 Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI) provided Minnesota policymakers and researchers with data about travel in the Minneapolis - St. Paul region. It also updated the region's travel demand forecasting, including transit ridership for major transportation projects. The Metropolitan Council in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area conducted the survey. The TBI consists of a paper-based survey and a wearable global positioning system survey. The data collection process for these two surveys was independent, and the results are not intended to function together.",

The Mid-Region Council of Governments contracted with Westat to conduct the survey, which included the collection of socio-demographic data and a one-day (24-hour) period of household travel behavior collected during weekdays (Monday through Friday). The survey also included a random selection of a 20% subsample of households (1,023 participants) to take part in a wearable global positioning system, technology-based component of the study, which was used to assess the level of trip under-reporting from the self-reported component of the survey.",

      "description" : "The 2014-2015 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study collected information about household and individual travel patterns for residents throughout a four-county region in Washington State. Study results were used to update the region's travel and land-use models and to calibrate local traffic and travel models. The study also helped the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) and its regional partners develop plans that accommodate the diverse travel needs and preferences of residents. The Resource Systems Group administered the study on behalf of PSRC. Global positioning system (GPS)-equipped smartphones were used to provide data pertaining to the daily travel of 547 individual participants. Because the region's university students may have been underrepresented in the initial 2014 household travel study, the PSRC added a college-population travel survey in fall 2014. In spring 2015, a second household data collection effort was conducted to increase the frequency of data collection and to collect GPS data as well as a sample of longitudinal data from households that completed the 2014 survey.",

In 2002, the Puget Sound Regional Council received a grant from the Federal Highway Administration for a pilot project on congestion-based tolling. To test the hypothesis, the study placed global positioning system data loggers into the vehicles of about 275 households in the Seattle metropolitan area. The project recorded roughly 18 months of trip data (from November 2004 to April 2006) and included more than 400 vehicles. For most vehicles, the tolling influence experiment phase of the study began in July 2005 and lasted for 32 weeks. The three months immediately preceding the experiment period for each vehicle served as the control period.",

The Volpe Center conducted the survey on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Urban Partnership Agreement. The population surveyed included drivers, public transportation users, carpoolers, and vanpoolers using the I-85 corridor in Atlanta, Georgia. The survey was conducted in two phases—before and after toll implementation—to evaluate related attitude changes. The survey assessed route changes, trip timing, trip purpose, and travel mode (i.e., single-occupancy vehicle, carpool, or public transportation).",

The University of Maryland conducted the survey between October 2011 and February 2012 in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. Its goal was to increase understanding of the potential use of Maryland Route 200, a tolled freeway connecting Maryland's Montgomery County and Prince George's County. Dedicated in-vehicle GPS devices were installed in 260 vehicles to record location information every 60 seconds if movement was detected. Survey subjects partook in an initial participation form as well as a recall survey, providing social demographic information and a one-day travel diary.",

The Federal Highway Administration and Wisconsin Department of Transportation conducted the survey. The NHTS ran from March 2001 through May 2002, with data collection for the Wisconsin add-on occurring May 1, 2001, to May 6, 2002. The NHTS collected detailed information on travel behavior nationwide, as well as data on the demographic and socioeconomic composition of households. State transportation departments and metropolitan planning agencies had the opportunity to purchase extra household samples as part of the NHTS add-on program. These additional samples, along with national samples collected in the add-on areas, are compiled for use in transportation planning, forecasting, and research. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation participated in the NHTS add-on program and received a total of 17,610 household samples in Wisconsin. (The total number of household samples nationwide is 26,038.)",

The Federal Highway Administration and Wisconsin Department of Transportation conducted the survey from March 2008 through May 2009. It collected detailed information on travel behavior nationwide, as well as data on the demographic and socioeconomic composition of households. State transportation departments and metropolitan planning agencies had the opportunity to purchase extra household samples as part of the NHTS add-on program. These additional samples, along with national samples collected in the add-on areas, are compiled for use in transportation planning, forecasting, and research. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation participated in the NHTS add-on program and received a total of 1,707 household samples in Wisconsin.

The study was conducted on behalf of the Atlanta Regional Commission, and it is an essential element in the transportation planning and modeling efforts for the 13-county Atlanta region. The main objective of the study was to produce data that could be used to develop and calibrate travel demand models for use in travel forecasting, land use planning, and air quality planning to improve the transportation system. The second component in the survey was the deployment of an electronic travel diary with person-based GPS and an accelerometer to collect health and activity information. Travel data includes trip generation, trip distribution, and modal choice. The survey recruited a total of 12,184 households to participate in the study. Of these, 8,069 households (66%) completed travel. The 8,069 households, when weighted, represent 21,323 persons, 14,449 vehicles, and 126,127 places visited from April 2001 through April 2002.

The main one was to update the existing data for NCTCOG's regional travel. Secondly, the survey aimed to provide new data elements to upgrade existing models. A total of 9,398 households was recruited for the study. Of these, 3,996 (42.5%) provided complete information. The survey revealed households' travel behavior preferences through a collection of information about household characteristics and travel using a unique \"travel as an activity\" approach. Respondents were asked to account for all of their time, including both trips and activities, during weekdays from February 19, 1996, to June 30, 1996.",

The primary objective of this survey effort was to document demographic and travel behavior characteristics of regional travelers in order to update the current regional model and to develop a new, more robust travel demand model for the 12-county region. The 2006 survey was conducted in association with NuStats' DataSource and Louis Berger Group and was sponsored by the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, the Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro Metropolitan Planning Organization, the Triangle Transit Authority, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The project was conducted over an eleven-month period from August 2005 through June 2006. The survey utilized standard household travel survey methods, in which all household members from 5,107 households were asked to record all trips for a specified 24-hour period using a specially designed travel log on a non-holiday weekday.",

The purpose of the survey was to provide information suitable for gaining an in-depth understanding of the travel behavior of households and individuals, as well as the activities, demographics, and other factors that affect such behavior. The survey was a diary-type travel survey, in which detailed travel information and basic demographic and socioeconomic features were collected for each member of the 11,264 participating households during an entire travel day. The sample for analysis of resident-based weekday travel is 10,971 for the entire 28-county metro area. The weekend sample, comprised of 275 households, is restricted to the NJTPA counties of northern New Jersey and compliments the results of the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey for the entire area.",

The region includes all of Sacramento, Yolo, Yuba, and Sutter counties, as well as the western portions of Placer and El Dorado counties. The purpose of the survey was to obtain up-to-date information on the socioeconomic, demographic, and travel characteristics of the population. During their travel day, participating household members were asked to record travel information in a diary for the specified 24-hour period. The information documented by respondents includes trip activities, mode of transportation, trip times, and trip location. Demographic information includes gender, age, employment status, household income, and household size, as well as whether the respondent held a valid driver's license, whether the respondent was a student, and whether the respondent owned or rented a home.",

The survey was designed to examine the relationship between characteristics of households and travel behavior, as well as to provide information state and local decision makers require when considering future regional transportation needs and investments. In total, 2,375 households were recruited to participate in the study. Of these, 2,062 households completed travel diaries, and the information was retrieved from all household members older than age five. 2,049 were successfully geocoded to California state plane coordinates for home addresses. A total of 17,060 trips were profiled in the course of this survey during the assigned 24-hour weekday.",

The basic purpose for the survey was for the development of travel demand models to simulate the various components of travel behavior: auto ownership, trip frequency (trip generation), and the distribution of trips between origins and destinations by travel mode. Planners at MTC envisioned the 1990 survey as the first wave of a multi-wave household panel survey designed to capture both short- and long-term changes in regional travel behavior. The 1990 survey collected single-weekday travel data from nearly 9,900 Bay Area households and multiple-weekday travel data from nearly 1,500 households. The 1990 survey effort also included a separate sub-project, funded by the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District, to collect multiple-weekday travel data from 1,000 BART-using households. The BART survey and the MTC multiple-weekday survey were completed in the spring of 1990; the MTC single-weekday survey was continued and completed during the autumn of 1990.",

The goal of the study was to collect information on activities for all people in each household, regardless of age or relationship. Respondents were asked to record all activities, including trips, over a two-day period. The data gathered during the survey will be used for the area's long-term transportation and air quality planning needs. The survey collected both weekday and weekend multi-day data and was the first activity-based survey conducted in the Bay Area. It also included separate sub-projects. A stated preference congestion pricing survey was administered to 150 of the respondents with a follow-up survey conducted with 110 participants. A follow-up survey was also completed by over half of the 3,618 respondent households to update contact and demographic information. These participants were then used as a panel sample for the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey (NuStats Research and Consulting 1999).",

The survey was an activity-based travel survey that collected information on all in-home and out-of-home activities over a two-day period, including weekday and weekend pursuits. Like the 1990 survey, the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey also included an additional sample of 3,000 households using Bay Area Rapid Transit. Respondents were asked to report detailed information regarding their travel, including trip locations, mode of transportation, trip start and end times, trip purpose, and trip activities. Demographic variables include gender, age, employment status, occupation, income, education level, ethnicity, as well as whether a respondent held a valid driver's license, was a student, and had a disability.",

The Seattle Household Travel Survey Wave 1, conducted in 1989, was the first wave in a ten-part longitudinal panel survey initiated by the Puget Sound Regional Council to assess the travel patterns of households in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. The panel intended to serve three basic objectives: 1) to be a metropolitan “current population survey” to track changes in employment, work characteristics, household composition, and vehicle availability; 2) to monitor changes in travel behavior and responses to changes in the transportation environment; and 3) to examine changes in attitudes and values as they affect mode choice and travel behavior. This collection contains the first set of panel data for households in King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. A total of 1,687 households successfully completed a phone survey and returned completed travel diaries for household members age 15 and older. Respondents were instructed to record their mode of transportation, trip purpose, number of vehicle passengers, departure and arrival times, ride fare, and parking costs in a two-day trip diary. Demographic information for this study includes age, gender, education, employment status, and household income.",

Data collection for the second wave took place in the fall of 1990, which included full interviews and travel diaries, as well as some panel refreshment.

      "description" : "The Seattle Household Travel Survey Wave 6, conducted in the second and third quarters of 1996, was the sixth wave in a ten-part longitudinal panel survey of the travel patterns of households in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. The survey series was initiated in 1989 by the Puget Sound Regional Council. This collection contains the sixth set of panel data for approximately 2,000 households in King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. Due to various sources of attrition, approximately 20% of households needed to be replaced for each survey wave. The survey relied on the willingness of study area residents to 1) provide demographic information about their household, its members, and its vehicles; 2) document all travel for each household member, aged 15 years or older, for an assigned two-day period; and 3) agree to participate in additional survey waves. After an initial telephone screening, survey participants received mailed travel diaries to aid in documenting travel information for the two-day assessment period. Respondents were instructed to record their mode of transportation, trip purpose, number of vehicle passengers, departure and arrival times, ride fare, and parking costs. Demographic information for this study includes age, gender, education, employment status, and household income.",

NuStats Research and Consulting conducted the survey on behalf of the Puget Sound Regional Council. The purpose of the study was to provide data to continue developing and refining the Regional Travel Demand Forecasting Model, as well as to provide a better understanding of travel behavior in the Puget Sound region. The study area consists of King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. The resultant dataset will be used to fulfill the model's functions of estimating trip generation and distribution, mode choice, and assignments. The study had household members 16 years old or older keep track of travel for a 48-hour period. A total of 9,028 households were recruited to participate in the study. Of these, 6,000 households (66.5%) completed travel diaries, and the information was retrieved from all household members regardless of age. An “attitude” survey about transportation and land use issues was also mailed to household members 16 years old or older.",

This database both captures the current status of activity and travel in the region and includes attitudes, preferences, and choices about activities and travel. In the design of the 2006 survey, basic demographics, activities, and tour and travel characteristics were collected for every member (including children) of 4,746 households during a consecutive 48-hour travel period. Vehicle global positioning system (GPS) data were collected from a subsample of 220 of these households, including completed activity/travel diaries for each household member. (Up to three vehicles per household were equipped with GPS units). The final GPS tracking data contained detailed information on the travel paths of 220 households with two vehicles in the same 48-hour period recorded in the diaries.",

Information collected in the 1994 Household Travel Survey was an important component in the development of regional travel demand forecasting models used to predict changes in daily travel in response to current development trends and changes in regional transportation policies and programs. In two waves during the spring and fall of 1994, consultants for COG/TPB conducted a survey of daily travel by persons living in area households. The survey file contains travel information associated with 4,863 households residing in 13 jurisdictions comprising the greater Washington, D.C., region (approximately a 1-in-300 sample). The survey file contains 39,800 internal trip records with respect to the expanded cordon.",

The household travel survey, which was conducted from October through November, was one of several surveys conducted in the fall of 2005 for the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) of Washoe County, with the other surveys focusing on documenting transit usage, visitor travel behavior, and external travel through the region. The data collected were drawn from 1,174 households within the RTC planning area and contain information about 2,679 household members, 2,138 vehicles, and 11,077 unlinked trips. The household travel survey entailed the collection of activity and travel information for all household members regardless of age during a specific 24-hour period. The survey relied on the willingness of regional households to 1) provide demographic information about their household, its members, and its vehicles and 2) have all household members record all travel and activity for a specific 24-hour period, including address information for all locations visited, trip purpose, mode, and travel times.",

The study is an essential element in the transportation planning and modeling efforts for Yakima County. The purpose of the survey was to gather data on the socioeconomic characteristics and travel behavior of county residents, including household characteristics, person characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and travel-activity patterns. A total of 1,503 households were recruited to participate in the study, 1,107 of which provided travel data for all household members age 16 and older. Unweighted, the 1,107 households represent 3,084 persons (of which 2,221 were age 16 and older), had 2,138 vehicles available to them, and recorded a total of 7,369 trips.",

The purpose of the study was to provide data for the continuing development and refinement of the Regional Travel Demand Forecasting Model, as well as to provide a better understanding of travel behavior in the southern Puget Sound region of Washington. The resultant data set will be used to fulfill the model's functions of estimating trip generation and distribution, mode choice, and assignments. Participating households were assigned specific “travel days” to record their travel over a 48-hour period. A total of 2,465 households were recruited to participate in the study. Of these, 1,537 households completed travel diaries, and the information was retrieved from 3,653 household members regardless of age. Households member made 25,278 total trips during their 48-hour diary period.",

ADOT conducts such surveys every five to seven years, providing an essential snapshot of transportation behaviors and trends by asking how members of a household get around on a single day. The answers helped state, local, and federal officials decide when, where, and how to invest limited transportation funding to improve roads, public transportation, sidewalks, bike paths, and more. Demographic, socioeconomic, and travel information was gathered from 4,882 participants associated with 2,076 households. Participants received travel logs to record where members of their household went on an assigned travel day.",

      "description" : "The 1990 transit on-board survey aimed to update the 1988 survey, which was conducted as part of the Preliminary Engineering Study for the Hennepin County Light Rail Transit System. The 1988 study received Regional Transit Board funding, and survey results could be applied to a mode split model for projecting ridership on the proposed Light Rail Transit System. However, this survey was designed with the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory in mind. The intention had been to update the 1988 survey in 1990 to be compatible with the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory data. The results of the 1990 survey were used primarily to create a table of observed transit trips between each of the 1,200 traffic analysis zones in the region. This trip table was used to calibrate a new mode split model, which estimated future year travel by mode. The 1990 update survey focused on new routes and routes that had changed significantly since 1988. To preserve compatibility with the 1988 survey, the same survey questionnaire card was used, together with the same survey procedures for data collection. The procedures randomly sampled bus patrons during the transit trip, asking key questions about the patron and the transit trip. The survey card was intended for patrons to fill out quickly so it could be completed during the transit trip. The questions focused on conditions that have proven over time to significantly influence ridership. In all, a total of 20,126 valid survey records were processed. Adding surrogate trips, the survey data file is composed of a total of 27,159 trip records . About 10% of the records were filled out by persons who had answered more than one questionnaire.",

          "description" : "The 1990 transit on-board survey aimed to update the 1988 survey, which was conducted as part of the Preliminary Engineering Study for the Hennepin County Light Rail Transit System. The 1988 study received Regional Transit Board funding, and survey results could be applied to a mode split model for projecting ridership on the proposed Light Rail Transit System. However, this survey was designed with the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory in mind. The intention had been to update the 1988 survey in 1990 to be compatible with the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory data. The results of the 1990 survey were used primarily to create a table of observed transit trips between each of the 1,200 traffic analysis zones in the region. This trip table was used to calibrate a new mode split model, which estimated future year travel by mode. The 1990 update survey focused on new routes and routes that had changed significantly since 1988. To preserve compatibility with the 1988 survey, the same survey questionnaire card was used, together with the same survey procedures for data collection. The procedures randomly sampled bus patrons during the transit trip, asking key questions about the patron and the transit trip. The survey card was intended for patrons to fill out quickly so it could be completed during the transit trip. The questions focused on conditions that have proven over time to significantly influence ridership. In all, a total of 20,126 valid survey records were processed. Adding surrogate trips, the survey data file is composed of a total of 27,159 trip records . About 10% of the records were filled out by persons who had answered more than one questionnaire.",

      "description" : "The main purpose of the survey was to gather current data on how the transit system was being used in 2010. The survey asked passengers a series of questions about their household characteristics and the trip that they were making on the day of the survey. The survey was conducted in three phases between December 2010 and December 2011. Close to 1.1 million unlinked trips are made on an average weekday on all 140 routes systemwide. The survey results suggest several different populations of users. At the low end of the economic spectrum are passengers who really have no other transit option besides public transit. There is also a group of passengers that appear to be somewhat better off financially. They could be categorized as middle-income households, and many of these passengers may have other options for transportation, but they choose to take public transit because it makes sense for them from a financial or time-savings standpoint. Finally, there may be a smaller group of passengers who may live and work downtown in relatively high-paying positions. These passengers can afford to take a taxi but choose to ride transit because of its convenience.",
