# `json2html`: Convert LDP LLMD JSON to HTML

`json2html` is a simple conversion utility, intended to translate the low-level metadata (LLMD) used by the Livewire Data Platform (LDP) from its native JSON to HTML as part of the process of creating and publishing human-usable dictionaries for each dataset.

## Usage
For expediency, `json2html` is written as a CFML Web process and relies on a Web browser's native ability to print to PDF for the resulting dictionary published to the LDP site.

To invoke the process:

```
http[s]://{server:port}/{path}/json2html.cfm?f={json-filename}
```

where
- `server:port` is the server (and port, if needed) where the script is hosted
- `path` is the server-relative path to the script
- `json-filename` is the relative path to the LDP JSON file for which a dictionary is to be produced, and should include the file extension

## PDF Preparation Notes
I've found Firefox to be the most consistent at producing the needed PDF output from the HTML generated by the script, and use the following configuration options when printing:
- Orientation: Portrait
- Page Size: US Letter
- Options:
  - Turn on "Ignore Scaling and Shrink to Fit Page Width"
  - Turn on "Print Background Colors"
  - Turn on "Print Background Images"
- Clear all headers
- Clear all footers except the center footer, set to "Page # of #"
- To get the page footers to match the text of the document, set the browser's default fonts to match the styling in the markup:
  - Proportional: Sans Serif
  - Serif: IBM Plex Sans *(RS: I am unsure why this has to match, but it does?)*
  - Sans Serif: IBM Plex Sans

## TODO
- Re-write this in Python(?) for consistency with other tools
- Re-write this to include the ability to optionally skip the Web browser and go directly to PDF
